# Iris-Flowers-Classification

First, we perform the data processing and understand the features used in the dataset.

We used various ML algorithms for Iris-Flowers-Classification. For each ML model, we performed Hyperparameter tuning to get the better models and report the better models.

Here are the algorithms used:

1 Logistic Regression	

2	Decision Tree	

3	Random Forest

4	Gradient Boosting	

5	SVC	

6	KNN	

7 XGBoost

Before Hyperparameter tuning, the results are as follows:

Here are the Hyperparameters used for each model we tested

NOTE: Since the dataset is small, shuffling also does not help overfitting. Increasing test size is one solution.
